The problem of action is the problem of how can we act in the world. 

 One of the most popular frameworks for understanding action is, nowadays, the guidance theory of action (Ansecombe 1976; [Di Nucci, 2013; Frankfurt, 1978; Pollard, 2006](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?suoGyG); Zhu 2004). That is, in paradigmatic exercises of agency, individuals guide their activities toward some goal. They are in control over their activities. A central challenge for action theory is to explain how is it that individuals guide. This challenge is indeed an instance of the more general problem of how to accommodate individuals and their actions in the natural world, as explained by natural science. Two dominant traditions have so far approached this problem: primitivism [(Hornsby, 2004; Hyman, 2015; Steward, 2012)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?aSqbi7) and the causal theory [(D. Davidson, 1963; Mele, 2002)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qki9Er). Causal theorists appeal to causation by an intention, through a feedback mechanism, in explaining guidance. Primitivists postulate primitive agential capacities in their explanations. However, they are both unsatisfying theories: the latter neglect to explain how primitive capacities integrate with findings from natural science; the former does not explain why some feedback mechanism’s activity amounts to the agent’s guidance.

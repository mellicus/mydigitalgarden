# The Evolution of Cognitive Control

## Language Hypothesis
Ardila (2008) suggested that the *temporal organization of behaviour* depends on the grammatical ability to use verbs and represent those actions. -> that's because temporality requires a "before" and an "after", ie. something that changes. Therefore, the perception of action requires a single preadaptation that works for grammatical language and executive functioning. 

## [[Toolmaking Hypothesis]]
[Adornetti (2016)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01426/full) suggests that CC evolved much earlier, 1.7 mya with the evolution of *homo ergaster* into *homo erectus*. Specifically, the manufacturing of some achulean artefacts, required the subject to stick to a hierarchical plan, which would have been difficult to do without a proper functioning PFC. -> [[EVOLUTIONARY COGNITIVE ARCHEOLOGY]]. Knapping is very similar to storytelling: monitor past, current and future states and how they relate to a goal, and neuroimagining techniques have shown how PFC is active in both cases.

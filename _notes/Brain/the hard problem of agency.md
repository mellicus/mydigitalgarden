Agency is a mystery. The fact that entities can act and bring about *happenings* in the world is astounding. Actions, indeed, seem to come into beings *ex nihilo*, and their results are spectacular. How can we fit this apparently miraculous capacity into our naturalistic understanding of reality? 

[[Agency]] indeed is the real [[hard problem]] of metaphysiscs, not the *hard problem of consciousness* like Chalmers argued. Being a panpsychist I believe in continuity of nature for consciousness and that's not mysterious at all.

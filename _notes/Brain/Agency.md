# Function and Agency
To better fit agency in the natural world, it'd be cool to put "agency" in continuity with *function*

## More in depth
[[the hard problem of agency]]

Agency is a mystery. The fact that entities can act and bring about *happenings* in the world is astounding. Actions, indeed, seem to come into beings *ex nihilo*, and their results are spectacular. How can we fit this apparently miraculous capacity into our naturalistic understanding of reality? Personally, I am a panpsychist, thus I believe in the continuity of nature. But for consciousness is one thing; however, no one in their right mind would want to say that atoms or virus are agents or proto-agents. Therefore, how to make agential capacities explainable? My proposal is to put them in continuity with the teleological/etiological notion of function - a perfectly naturalistic concept.

# What is control?

Control, as a notion, started within the discipline of *cybernetics*.

**Cognitive control** is the ability to control one’s thoughts and actions.  It is also known as [controlled processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_and_controlled_processes "Automatic and controlled processes"), executive attention, and [supervisory attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisory_attentional_system "Supervisory attentional system"). Controlled behaviors, behaviors over which one has cognitive control, are guided by maintenance, updating, and representing task goals, and inhibiting information irrelevant to the task goal.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(psychology)#cite_note-6) Cognitive control is often developed through reinforcement as well as learning from previous experiences. Increased cognitive control allows individuals to have increased flexibility in their ability to choose between conflicting stimuli.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(psychology)#cite_note-7) Cognitive control is commonly tested using the [Stroop color-word task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect "Stroop effect") as well as the [Eriksen flanker task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eriksen_flanker_task "Eriksen flanker task").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(psychology)#cite_note-8)

## Control and the problem of action
How can we use the notion of cognitive control to solve [[the problem of action]]? By analysing its [[evolution]]

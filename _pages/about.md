# Who am I?
✨Hey everyone! ✨

My name is Marco, and this is my 🌱*digital garden*🌱. I mainly use it to organise and store my notes for my various projects, so it's unlikely that you'll find something useful or of intererest. Anyway, if you'd like to stick your nose in here, make yourself at home! 🏠

On these pages, you'll find my ideas about Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science 🧠 - especially related to the evolution of agency, panpsychism and 4E cognition, as these are my areas of specialisation. 
🔮 Occasionally, there may be some pages on Utopias, Speculative Optimism and South American Literature, as I am too lazy to split my work-related notes from my random, free time notes 🔮

💎 I have a **BA** in Philosophy, and an **MA** in Philosophy and Cognitive Science, and right now I'm a *visiting researcher* at the Institut Jean Nicod in Paris, where I'm working on Cognitive Control. I also have a newsletter, [Speculum](https://speculum.substack.com/), where I write about the relationship between philosophy and the political practice of imagining new futures. Sometimes, I also work freelance as a cultural journalist 📰 

🗺️ Originally, I am from Arce📍, a small town in the centre of Italy, not really far from Rome. However, I studied in Turin📍 and Amsterdam📍, and I'm now living in Paris📍

# The Eerie Mind ğŸŒ±
<div align="right"> *ğŸ”® Voll Verdienst, doch dichterisch wohnet der Mensch auf dieser Erde ğŸ”®* </div>

*Consciousness* is at once the most certain of all realities and the grandest unknown and sublime mystery of our existence, apart perhaps from only our existence itself. Why does it feel something to be alive? Why does existing have aÂ _taste?_Â Humanity has wrestled so much with this conundrum that in philosophy it is now known through an unequivocal nickname: theÂ [[_hard problem_]]. TheÂ hard problem of consciousnessÂ is the problem of explaining why and howÂ some organisms haveÂ phenomenalÂ experiencesâ€”how and why it is that some internal states areÂ _felt_, such as heat or cold, the quality of deep blue, or the sensation of a musical note. How can we explain why there is something it is like to entertain a thought or to have an emotion? Even if one accepts that experience arises from a physical basis, it is still unclear why and how it so arises. The question asked is not only how it is possible that we are conscious butÂ _why_Â is there something that it is like to be us, in the first place?Answering this question may uncover all sorts of horror about the nature of our very existence and of the universe in general. For often, questions about consciousness necessarily lead us to gaze at the abyss that is theÂ _fundamental_â€”_and cosmic_â€”_question of metaphysics:_Â why is there something instead of nothing? Self-interrogations about why I am conscious, reflections (both literal and metaphorical) in front of a mirror on the strange semantics of words like â€˜Iâ€™, â€˜meâ€™â€”why is this me? How come this is me? Or general awe at the concept of subjectivity, of â€˜I-ness,â€™ of being a selfâ€”naturally bring about the even harder question of â€˜why do I existâ€™?

For Martin Heidegger, it was only throughÂ _Dasein_Â that the problems of being and existence could be posed, that is to say that it is only through consciousness that existence presents problems. The horror of consciousness is the horror of existence. And consciousness has a horrific, weird component (as does existence), or better, to put it in Mark Fisherâ€™s words, it contains a profoundlyÂ _eerie_Â component. The feeling of the eerie is concerned with the inexplicability of certain agencies: when there are traces and signs of an agency that shouldnâ€™t be there or there is a lack of signs and traces of an agency that is there, we feel that something eerie is going on. And the phenomenon of consciousness is precisely this: the existence of an agency that shouldnâ€™t be there, it is not even close to clear why some bare flesh, organic wet matter, should give rise to the world of most beautiful endless forms that is our inner life. So consciousness is a phenomenon that we canâ€™t even hope to explain and that we donâ€™t fully comprehend; and yet that consciousness is us, the same entity that it is posing the problem. 

**Subjects are the very aliens to themselves, and subjectivity is eerie.
